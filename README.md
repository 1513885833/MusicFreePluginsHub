# MusicFreePluginsHub

A personal MusicFree plugin subscription aggregator - Github Actions automatically detects and synchronizes updates daily.

## Lazy Subscriber Link:

Behind the wall:

https://musicfreepluginshub.2020818.xyz/plugins.json

International:

https://musicfreepluginshub.pages.dev/plugins.json

## Self-Deployment

After forking and enabling actions, set the Workflow permissions in the Action menu of the repository to Read and write. Actions can be triggered manually or automatically execute at UTC 20:00, generating a plugins.json file.

Obtain the direct link to your own accessible plugins.json to use.

The lazy link is deployed through Cloudflare Pages. You can also deploy direct links on similar platforms like Vercel, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc., and bind a custom domain for access within the wall.
